# About Me

Hi! Here is Wenxi Chen (陈文熙). I am an undergraduate student at  Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), majoring in computer science.  Since 2023, I have been working as a research intern at the [X-Lance Lab](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn) at SJTU, under the supervision of Prof. [Xie Chen](https://chenxie95.github.io/).


I'm generally interested in understanding & generation in speech and audio, as well as multimodal large language model. My previous projects have involved audio self-supervised learning, audio scene classification, and audio captioning.
