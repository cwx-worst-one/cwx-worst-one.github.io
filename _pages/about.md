# About Me

Hi! Here is Wenxi Chen (陈文熙). I am an undergraduate student of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), majoring in computer science.  I am now working as a research intern at the [X-Lance Lab](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn) at SJTU since 2023, supervised by Prof. [Xie Chen](https://chenxie95.github.io/).

I'm generally interested in understanding & generation in speech and audio, as well as multimodal large language model. My previous projects involve audio self-supervised learning, audio scene classification and audio captioning.
